# Adopt Markdown Any Decision Records

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

The goal of Lazarus is to learn about the steps and tools required to operate software.
Especially, how DevOps tools and practices can make that process easier.

To that end, it's important that
the contributors to this project
understand the tradeoffs and alternatives
to the tools and practices they choose.

It's easy for thoughts and ideas around this understanding to be lost.
Thus some kind of documentation is vital.

## Considered Options

* No documentation
* Private notes
* Blog posts
* Ad-hoc markdown files
* Markdown Any Decision Records (MADRs)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Markdown Any Decision Records

### MADR benefits

They are:

* are simple to use
* create a specific location where decisions can be found in the project
* can be seen and read by anyone joining or reviewing the project
* allow us to specify a template, reducing friction

### Open a new MADR

* Use the template and pick the next number
* Create a pull request with the new MADR
* Discuss the decision with other members of the project
* Capture and commit updates with additional context, alternatives, or decision explanation.

### Private notes and blog posts

These are great and are still encouraged,
but they're kept separate from the project
which increases the likelihood of drift or loss of information.

### Ad-hoc markdown files

These may still be useful,
but the lack of standardization may make it hard for someone to find.
Someone, in this case, may include our future selves.
